This project introduces my book *Intro to Puritism*, which delves into the philosophy and principles behind Puritism. The work focuses on purity of thought, action, and intention as a guide to living a more refined and disciplined life. It complements my larger vision for [Classical Education]() and personal philosophical explorations.
